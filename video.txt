So the number one question that I've been getting
since my last video on Open Claw is,
what are you actually having your team of agents do?
And I get it, use cases for Open Claw
are what everyone wants to know about.
But here's the thing, my use case
is probably gonna be different from yours
and yours is gonna be different from the next person's.
So the specific tasks that you hand to your agents
will always depend on your business,
your operations, your goals.
So yes, I will share what I'm having
my team of agents work on.
But more importantly, I wanna give you a framework,
a mental model for how to think about
structuring your operation
so that you can actually hire a team of Open Claw agents
to work in your business.
You know, I think that most people are approaching
Open Claw right now like a personal assistant
or maybe even an extension of themselves.
So if they would chat with it and when they need something
they give it a task and wait for a result and repeat.
But that's not how I'm using it.
I'm treating Open Claw like I'm creating real jobs
in my business and hiring agents to fill them.
So there's a big difference between these two mindsets.
One keeps you as the bottleneck,
the other actually scales.
So I wanna frame this through some lessons
that I've learned from hiring and managing real teams
in my businesses over the years.
You know, these principles carry over
more than you would think.
But we'll also look at where hiring agents
has some unique advantages over human hires
and how it changes the equation
in some really interesting ways.
Now if you're new here, I'm Brian Castle.
I help builders navigate this transition
to working with AI.
And every Friday I send my builder briefing.
It's my free five minute read
where I break down what I'm learning
as I build and ship and work with agents week to week.
No hype, just my take on what I'm seeing.

Now let me know if you've seen this.
If you've tried to delegate tasks to an agent
or even a human teammate,
you spend more time explaining how you want it done
than it would have taken you to just do it yourself.
And once they finish,
you're scrambling to find the next thing to keep them busy.
Well, that's what happens when you delegate tasks
instead of defining jobs.
What I learned from building real teams
is that a hire only works
when there's a steady flow of recurring needs
that a role needs to fill.
Not one-off tasks that you're pulling out of thin air
but work that comes back on a predictable cadence
every day, every week, every month.
You hire when you have a job to fill
and a job is a recurring need.
Now here's where using something like open claw
to hire agents changes the equation
in a really interesting way.
When you're hiring a person,
you need to justify that hire.
You need enough recurring work to fill a full-time role
or at least enough for a meaningful part-time commitment.
You know, nobody's gonna take a job
that's just two tasks a week.
So you end up waiting until the need is big enough
to justify the cost and the overhead of bringing someone on.
But when you're hiring agents,
that constraint doesn't exist.
You can start with one or two recurring tasks.
There's no minimum.
There's no salary to justify.
You're paying pennies or a couple dollars per task
in token costs.
So the threshold for creating a new role
is dramatically lower.
And that means you can start to scale your team
and your business way sooner than you could have before.
You don't have to wait around
until you can afford a full-time hire
to start getting recurring work off your plate.
You can start freeing up bandwidth now
and put that time back into things
that actually grow your business.
So let me show you how I'm applying this thinking
to my business.
I identified two types of recurring tasks
that I could build into jobs for my agents.
First, there are things that I'm currently doing
that I wanna get off my plate.
And second, there are things
that aren't currently getting done,
you know, missed opportunities
that I can now start to take advantage of.
Now, your business might be different than mine,
but hopefully that mental model helps you go through
the same exercise that I did.
Now, in my case, research and content production
make up most of the big recurring tasks in my work week.
So naturally that's where I started.
My starting point when figuring out my recurring needs
and processes in my business was to use Claude
as a thought partner in this process,
which I'm doing almost all the time these days.
So here's an example of just one of many conversations
that I've been having with Claude over the past month.
You know, you can see it goes super deep back and forth.
It actually started with a prompt that looks like this.
And when you see a big wall of text,
that usually means it was a voice recording.
And I think I was actually out on a walk
when I recorded this.
So, you know, sort of just like brain dumping
my content production process
and getting Claude's feedback on that.
And then trying to kind of hammer out
what this would look like to have a team helping me
in the research and planning and production
of the content that I produce.
And so, you know, lots of details goes into this,
lots of changing of direction and trying out, you know,
different cadences, different mechanics,
if you will, in this process.
But ultimately that messy back and forth strategy conversation
turns into skills.
And I'm gonna talk more about skills later in this video,
how they work into the system here.
But, you know, skills are files that live in my file system.
And so this is where I can actually work on them
and then continue to refine them using Claude code.
So here is a conversation that I've been having
with Claude code to rework and improve some of the processes
that are built into the skills
that my agents use in our task system.
And so once I have, you know, all these custom built skills
which define processes in my business,
I'm able to use my task system, another custom built app
I'll talk more about later in this video.
And you can see each of these recurring tasks,
it doesn't actually include detailed instructions,
it just instructs the agent to use a specific skill
and then carefully read its instructions and run them there.
So I'll talk more about that in just a minute.
So you've identified your recurring tasks,
you know what jobs your agents need to do,
but here's where it's easy to get stuck.
You end up being the one who kicks off every task.
So every morning you open up Telegram
and send your agent a message,
hey, go do that thing again,
and then you wait for the result
and then you do the same thing again tomorrow.
That's not delegating,
you're just creating another job for yourself.
Think about it this way,
when you hire someone to join your team,
you shouldn't need to remind them
to do their job every day.
If you're doing that, then either they're a bad employee
or you're not a great manager.
I mean, the whole point of hiring
is to have the needs of your business get handled
without you needing to initiate and instruct
and prompt every single time.
And for that, you need systems.
And when it comes to running a team of agents,
I found that there are three systems
that you'll need to build.
So your agents need to know what to do and when to do it,
without you being the one to press go.
Now, Open Claw has a built-in CRON system,
but I found it to be too limited
for a multi-agent setup like mine.
It was hard to associate scheduled tasks
with specific agents on my team.
So let me show you this custom app that I built
called BMHQ, it's my builder methods HQ.
It's kind of like my mission control dashboard
for running my team of multiple agents with Open Claw.
It's a simple Rails app that's actually running
on the Mac mini where Open Claw is running.
It's got a bunch of features built into it,
but the one that I use all the time every day
is the tasks board.
And it's set up like a simple Kanban
and it's got a few different modes.
This one is like the traditional, you know,
scheduled queue in progress and done,
but what I actually find more useful
is the view that breaks it down by agent.
And so these are all of the recurring tasks
that each agent is responsible for.
It has a system of setting up task templates.
So these are the tasks that are used
every time we, you know, regenerate the recurring tasks.
Over here, I can manage all the different schedules
for each task.
So some of them run daily, some of them run three times a day,
some of them run twice a week, sometimes monthly.
And I've got this section called pre-instruction.
So these are things that I want kind of prepended
to every single task.
But then in the tasks themselves,
I can add instructions here.
Although these instructions tend to be really simple
because most of the time I'm just pointing my agents
to run a specific skill that I've developed
and put into my system.
And I'm gonna talk more about skills in just a minute.
Now, all of the scheduling and dispatching of tasks
to my agents happens through my own custom application.
So we have this section of code
that runs when a task is scheduled to be done by an agent,
it dispatches that task directly into the Open Claw Gateway.
So it sort of assembles the task instructions
and assigns it to the right agent.
And so this system with a bit more logic under the hood
helps me assign specific tasks to agents
and have those agents pick them up and execute them.
And then those agents actually message me back
on Telegram when it's done.
Now, another cool thing here
is that I can open up any individual task.
I see the activity status of everything
that happened here in the board,
but I'm also capturing all of the execution logs.
So these are the actual execution logs
from the Open Claw Gateway.
I almost never need to look at these,
but if anything goes wrong or we run into a hitch
with the process or with the instructions,
I can see everything that happened
with this task here in the logs.
I mean, it's really good for troubleshooting issues.
And when you're getting up and running
with Open Claw, especially if you're building
a sophisticated task system like this,
you know, it's really gonna take a few weeks
to hammer out all the bugs and all the quirks.
That's sort of just the nature of Open Claw
since it's still very early.
By the way, in my membership, Builder Methods Pro,
I'm doing a deeper dive into the design
and the structure of this BMHQ app
and all of the other custom projects that I do.
In there, I do what I call ride along videos for members.
So that covers the scheduling system for your agents.
Now we've got two more systems to figure out
in order for your team to really be productive.
So when your agents are running jobs on a recurring basis,
you need them to follow a consistent process
every single time.
Now, the key is to be able to improve your processes
over time because the first version of any workflow
is never gonna be perfect.
I'm constantly reviewing the output
and identifying what's off and tightening up
my team's processes so that the next run is better.
Now, where should those instructions for your agents live?
You could bake them into the task itself,
but then every time you wanna improve the process,
you're editing or rewriting task instructions.
This is where skills come in.
If you've worked with skills in Claude Code
or Cursor or Codex, it's the same concept here.
Skills are just folders with a markdown file
plus optional reference files and scripts
to support the process.
A skill is the operating manual for a particular job.
It lives in one place,
so it's easy for you and for your agents to read.
And most importantly, it's where you go to work
on your business because when you're improving
your set of skills,
you're literally making your team of agents
better at their jobs.
All right, so let's dive into my growing collection
of custom built skills,
which I'm using as the processes
or the operating manual for my agents
to work in my business.
Now, to show you where these skills
actually live in the system,
I'm opening up a screen sharing window on the Mac,
which is looking into the actual screen of the Mac Mini,
which is sitting on my desk.
That's the Mac Mini where I'm running OpenClaw.
And so now I'm like looking at that machine
and this is a finder window in there.
I'm looking at the home directory for the OpenClaw user,
which by the way, is its own user on the machine.
It's not my user, not the admin user.
I talked more about the security and the setup
of my OpenClaw system in my previous video on the channel.
So here in the home directory,
I've got the dot OpenClaw folder
and inside that is the skills folder.
Now, I could have also put the skills folder
in the workspace folder, which would work just fine.
I put it up here.
In case I ever go with like multiple workspaces,
then all the agents and all the workspaces
could access the same set of skills.
Currently, I'm actually having multiple agents
share the same workspace,
another story that I got into in the other video.
But anyway, all of the skills are here.
Now, something that you might notice if you look closely,
this is actually a sim link.
This folder is actually pointing to a version of that folder,
which is living in a Dropbox folder
that I called OpenClaw.
And that's where this the skills folder
along with a couple of other key folders
are sim linked into there.
So why did I set up that whole sim link system?
Well, that's how I can easily access
the same set of files on one of my Macs.
And so these files are being synced using Dropbox.
Again, I talked more about my Dropbox sharing system
in the other video.
It's actually set up in a way
so that OpenClaw only has access
to a certain subset of my files.
It doesn't have access to my entire Dropbox
and some other sensitive stuff that's in there.
Here is the set of skills,
which is growing and constantly changing.
Again, I'm constantly working on
and improving the skills that run my agents in my business.
This one happens to be one for content development.
I'm still kind of working this out,
but this one is basically just one big skill.md file
where we do some kind of planning and research
and drafting of ideas.
And I've got a couple of other skills.
A lot of them right now are built around
capturing all the activity that I work on
from transcripts that I publish to my content
to the code activity that's happening in GitHub
and the code activity that I'm even capturing
from my cloud code conversations.
So actually one of my skills here
is called code activity capture.
So here's the skill that one of my agents handles
and this has two pieces to it.
One is capturing the activity from my cloud code sessions
and storing it into markdown files.
And the other is actually running this script.
So here's a script that we wrote up
to pull all of the activity from all of my GitHub repos.
And again, it's going into these like code summaries
that my team is then documenting into my brain system.
I'm gonna talk more about the documentation
and the markdown files coming right up in this video.
So again, skills are where I go to tinker
and work on my processes.
And for most of the time,
I actually use cloud code to help me with that task
of going through and making improvements to my skills.
So, I'll usually like prompt in here to talk about
what I wanna change in my operation or my system
or even some details like how I want the agents
to craft their messages back to me
or the sequence that I want them to work in.
I'll collaborate with cloud code on those changes
and have them done directly into the skills files.
And then my team works off of these.
So over in my tasks board,
which lives in my BMHQ dashboard here,
again, if I look at the instructions on any of these tasks,
I could have given this agent all the detailed instructions,
but instead I'm pointing this agent
to go to my content radar scan skill.
That's a skill where my marketing agent
is going to scan for announcements from companies
and people that I wanna follow in the industry
to stay up on some research tasks.
So this agent collects that kind of stuff
and puts it into a report that helps me stay on top of stuff,
but also helps my team and I draft ideas for content.
So that is a high level look
at how I'm putting these skills together.
At this time, I'm not gonna be releasing these skills
as like an open source thing
because they're just changing so much from day to day
and they're highly personalized to my business.
But again, inside my membership,
I talk more about how I structure these operations
and I will be doing more of that in the future.
Just wanted to give you this high level look for now.
So we figured out our scheduling system.
We've set up processes for our agents using skills
now for the final piece.
When your agent finishes a task,
where does their output go?
How do you know it was done?
How do you review it?
Now we know that Open Claw is built around
your chat sessions with agents,
but that's only one piece of this.
Sure, I want my agents to proactively message me
about updates on the tasks that they're working on.
And in my task instructions,
I even dial in exactly how I want those messages sent to me.
But more importantly, the work that my agents
and I do together has to produce artifacts.
And in this new world of teaming up with agents,
it's best that we start to organize our business
around markdown files.
So to make that easier, I built myself an app
that I call Braindown.
It's a markdown editor and viewer
that lets me and my agents send links
to our markdown files that live in our shared Dropbox.
This makes it much easier than having to remote
into the Mac mini and locate those files
and open them in a text editor.
In 2026, it's actually easier and better
to just build your own tools to power your business.
Now, I currently use Claw code primarily to build my tools.
Could I just have Open Claw agents build my tooling for me?
Sure, but I actually see that as a core part
of what I do.
I'm working on my business by building these systems
that enable me to delegate jobs to agents.
So here's a look at my telegram
where I have all four of my agents
in a dedicated agents folder separate from my humans folder.
And here is my chat with Gumbo.
That's my general assistant.
And so you can see in the most recent one,
he did his normal intake processing
where he's capturing all of the activity in my business
and storing it into markdown files.
And when he does, he links me to these markdown files
that live on my system.
So where do these links actually point to?
Well, they actually point to markdown files
on my braindown app.
So if I click this link,
it'll open up in my braindown app.
Now, I'm still working on the styling of this.
And this happens to be my daily note
that my agent will sort of compile as the day goes on.
Today is still in progress.
And so here's one from a few days ago,
some items for me to take a look at.
This is one part of the brain system
that helps us capture summaries of what's going on
that we can then use in content production
and other strategic planning stuff.
But now what I'm seeing here is a file
which I could edit and I can do things in,
but that's a file that actually lives on my file system.
These are actual just markdown files that live in the brain.
All of this is accessible in the file system
for my agents and for me to work on.
But it's also really easy for me
to just receive a message from Telegram
and then hop right into a braindown
and then be able to use this to quickly get
to some of my files and folders.
So the braindown app actually integrates with Dropbox
and that's how we sync
between what's actually on our file systems
and here in this easy to use app,
which I'm still refining it,
but it's all mobile friendly.
I like to use it on my mobile device a lot.
And you know, drop down notes and read the notes
that my agents are sending me from Telegram.
And by the way, I can also capture new notes
by writing out a new note or using a voice recording
or uploading a recording or files and images.
All of that easily gets captured into markdown
and files that gets synced into Dropbox.
So it's a really easy thing.
I've only been working on this for a few days
and it's just a really good example
of a custom built tool that helps me
run my operation with my agents.
Now you'll probably hear me continue to repeat this,
but the real value of Open Claw,
whether you're running a solo business or a larger company,
is to think of it like an employee
or even better, a team of employees
that fill real job functions in your business.
The difference now is that getting started
is more a matter of building the right systems
rather than needing to justify taking on the cost
and the commitment of additional full-time salaries.
Now, like I said, the jobs that I'm hiring
my Open Claw agents for are less about coding
and more about freeing me up to spend my time
building tools and improving the systems
that help me grow my business.
So day to day, I'm still very much a builder.
And Claude Code continues to be my go-to
for being able to design and build any tool that I want
in a matter of days.
Now, if you're new to building your own tools
using Claude Code, now is a great time to become a builder.
I made a video a couple of weeks ago
to show you how in 2026,
building with Claude Code doesn't have to be over complicated.
Check that out and let me know
if you find these videos helpful.
So right after you hit subscribe on the channel,
I'll see you over there next.
Let's keep building.
